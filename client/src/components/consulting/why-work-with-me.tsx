              Pattern recognition from regulated environments

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Ten years in fintech and financial services means I've seen how
              initiatives fail—and why. The same patterns show up across
              industries: scope that drifts, dependencies that multiply,
              stakeholders who stop trusting the plan. I recognize these signals
              early, before they become expensive problems.

              Experience taking over stalled initiatives
            </h3>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I've repeatedly stepped into projects that were months behind with
              low confidence. The work isn't about adding process—it's about
              identifying what's actually blocking progress, clarifying ownership,
              and rebuilding trust through delivery. The case studies above show
              this pattern: failing initiatives turned into shipped outcomes.

              Surfacing risk before it becomes failure
            </h3>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Most delivery problems have early warning signs. Teams ignore them
              because they're subtle—a missed sprint here, a vague requirement
              there. I map where context gets lost, where handoffs break, and
              where coordination overhead compounds. Then we fix the real
              problems, not the symptoms.

              Judgment over frameworks
            </h3>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I don't arrive with a playbook. Every team's friction is different,
              and the right solution depends on context: team size, system
              complexity, stakeholder dynamics. I diagnose first, then apply
              judgment about what will actually work—not what a framework says
              should work.
