# Product Party Content System

Voice: One cup of coffee with a colleague. Alert but not jittery. Practical wisdom from someone who's navigated similar challenges.

## Flexible Post Structures

Choose structure based on what the post needs. Not every post follows the same formula.

**Story-Led** (when you have a strong personal experience)
- Open with specific scene (time, place, sensory detail)
- Let the story carry the insight
- Framework emerges naturally at the end, or not at all
- Best for: career lessons, failures, turning points

**Framework-Led** (when you've discovered a repeatable pattern)
- State the problem sharply
- Present the framework with specific examples
- Story supports but doesn't dominate
- Best for: process posts, how-tos, diagnostic tools

**Data-Led** (when numbers tell the story)
- Lead with the surprising statistic
- Contextualize what it means
- Add personal angle or company example
- Best for: industry analysis, trend pieces

**Conversational** (when you're thinking out loud)
- Shorter, more exploratory
- Questions welcome
- Less structured, more voice
- Best for: observations, provocations, community engagement

**Hybrid** (most common)
- Mix elements based on what serves the insight
- No rigid percentages required
- Let the material dictate the shape

## Voice Rules

**Always use:**
- Conversational tone (colleague, not blogger)
- Paragraph breaks every 2-3 sentences
- First/second person engagement
- Specific over generic, context over theory
- Personal experience or real examples

**Never use:**
- Em-dashes (—)
- "Here's what happened"
- "I didn't expect"
- Section headers starting with "The"
- Generic "lessons learned" framing
- Corporate jargon
- Emojis

## Banned Phrases

### Authority Signaling
- "Nobody talks about…"
- "What people don't realize…"
- "Here's the thing…"
- "The truth is…"
- "Let me be clear…"
- "Here's what X doesn't want you to know…"
- "And honestly?" (as transition filler)
- "But here's where it gets interesting:"
- "Here's what [experience] taught me…"

### AI Tells
- "No fluff" / "Shouting into the void" / "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack"
- "Here's the key takeaway" / "The important part is" / "What this really means"
- "Curious what others think?" (unless genuinely inviting dialogue)
- Overuse of "It's not X, it's Y" (once per piece maximum)

## Writing Like a Human (Anti-Detection)

AI detectors flag predictable, uniform text. Counter with:

**Vary sentence length dramatically.** Three words. Then a longer sentence that takes its time getting to the point. Then medium. AI writes consistently. Humans don't.

**Add burstiness.** Mix sentence structures within paragraphs. Start some with "I." Start others with the subject. Throw in a fragment. Ask a question?

**Use specific, unfalsifiable details.** Not "last week" but "Tuesday at 2pm." Not "a meeting" but "the Q3 planning review with the infrastructure team." Details only you would know.

**Include time/place markers.** "Writing this from gate B7, delayed again." "It's 11pm and I'm still thinking about this." Harry Dry's "3:47am, green tea, looking at the whiteboard."

**Make unexpected word choices.** Don't always reach for the obvious adjective. "The meeting was brutal" is fine. "The meeting was somehow both boring and panic-inducing" is better.

**Leave some roughness.** Not every sentence needs to be polished. Sometimes "That's weird, right?" works better than a crafted observation. Humans write with personality quirks.

**Avoid parallel structure overuse.** AI loves lists where every item has the same grammatical form. Mix it up. One item can be a phrase. Another a full sentence. Another a question.

**State opinions without hedging.** "I think this is wrong" not "It could be argued that this approach may have some drawbacks." Humans commit.

## Headline Patterns

**Required:** 50% of posts should use contrarian framing.

### Proven Patterns

1. **Sabotage:** "Your [strength] is sabotaging your [goal]"
2. **False Aspiration:** "[Assumption] might not exist"  
3. **Problem Diagnosis:** "Why [subject] [counterintuitive behavior]"
4. **Process Critique:** "How we turned [good thing] into [bad thing]"
5. **Reversal:** "X isn't the problem. Y is."
6. **Hidden Cost:** "The $[specific] problem hiding in [familiar place]"

### Headline DNA
- Direct address ("Your...") performs well
- Statements outperform questions
- Combining direct address + statement = highest performing

## SUCCES Audit

Every post should pass most of these (not necessarily all six every time):

☐ **Simple:** One core message in one sentence
☐ **Unexpected:** Challenges an assumption
☐ **Concrete:** Specific examples, not abstractions
☐ **Credible:** Personal experience OR data OR real company examples
☐ **Emotional:** Clear why readers should care NOW
☐ **Story:** Transformation arc OR diagnostic framework

## Theme Mix (Guideline, Not Rule)

Roughly aim for across your portfolio:
- 40% Product Strategy (features, metrics, roadmaps)
- 30% Career Development (job market, positioning, skills)
- 20% Process/Team (meetings, coordination, decisions)
- 10% Technical/Building (tools, side projects)

Individual posts don't need to fit neatly. The mix matters over time.

## Final Checks

Before publishing:
- Does it sound like a colleague, not a blog post?
- Can readers apply this Monday?
- Is there at least one detail only I would know?
- Did I vary my sentence lengths?
- Did I challenge something they currently believe?
