## The Pattern

These projects show:
1. **Willingness to ship** - Multiple projects across different platforms
2. **Learning in public** - Games, utilities, experiments alongside polished products
3. **AI-native thinking** - MCP servers, AI analyzers, building with AI tools
4. **Practical problem-solving** - Most projects solve a real personal need

## Interview Questions
