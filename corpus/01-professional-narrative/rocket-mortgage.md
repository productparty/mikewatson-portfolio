## The Real Story

### The Arc: BA to Product Owner

I came to Rocket fresh out of consulting, starting as a business analyst on the loan origination platform doing traditional BA work. By the time I left seven years later, I was a Product Owner embedded with a data science team, owning a chatbot that could either hand off to real people or work directly with potential customers to capture their data and turn it into qualified leads.

The shift from BA to Product Owner wasn't a personal epiphany - it was organizational. Rocket made a deliberate move away from the traditional model where business consultants and business owners dictated what had value. They started pulling high-performing BAs into Product Owner roles, making us responsible for full backlogs and for identifying business and customer value ourselves.

I was already working closely on empathizing with users, so the transition wasn't jarring. But here's the counterintuitive part: I actually became *less* technical as I moved into product, not more. To continue showing value, I had to lean harder into understanding the business - what leadership actually cared about, where we could move the needle, speaking their language instead of technical language.

### Spanish-Preferred Leads: Making the Invisible Visible

The resume says I "identified a 300% increase in Spanish-preferred leads." Here's what actually happened.

I spent time on the floor with salespeople and noticed they had no good way to identify Spanish-speaking customers. The process was brutal - both for the banker and the client. They had to use a language line with a third person translating, which made everything slow and awkward.

Worse, we had no idea how many people we were actually failing to serve. With so many leads flowing in, bankers would just skip these customers rather than deal with the friction. They were being disregarded, not helped.

Our initial data showed maybe 1,000 to 2,000 potential customers per month. But once we built the tools to actually count properly, we discovered it was five times that - and growing month over month. We just hadn't created the instrumentation to see how big the opportunity was.

Once the numbers were visible, the ball started rolling. We enhanced processes and technology to connect these customers to the right people. Then we quickly realized those people were overwhelmed. Within six months, we had to stand up a dedicated 50-person bilingual sales team just to handle the demand we'd surfaced.

The lesson: sometimes the biggest value a PM can add is creating visibility into a problem that was invisible.

### Speech Analytics: From 50 Bankers to 3,000

The speech analytics pilot started with 50 bankers - just to see if we could get the technology to work. We did, and the appetite for insights grew fast. The compliance use cases alone made banking leadership want to analyze every recorded call across the organization.

Multiple business units started signing up like it was a product launch. We went from 50 bankers to roughly 3,000 team members' calls being analyzed daily. What started as a "can we make this work?" experiment became enterprise infrastructure.

### Salesforce Migration: Translating Pain into Design

For the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud migration, I was part of a small team where each person owned a business area they knew well. My domain was client services and operations.

The client services team was navigating 20+ applications at any given time. When a customer called, a rep might have to touch 5 to 10 different systems in a single conversation. My job was to dig deep into their pain points and map those into a future state design - then feed those insights to the consulting companies actually building the solution.

I was the translator between the messy reality of "20 apps in one call" and the consultants designing the consolidated experience.

### What Shaped Me

The most important thing I took from seven years at Rocket: an appreciation for how failure and iteration can transform something that barely limps into production into something spectacular - for both customers and the business.

Sometimes people get caught up in trying to hit the home run. But you can still win the baseball game with many singles that accumulate runs over time.

## Key Themes
- Floor observation beats dashboard analysis for finding real problems
- Creating visibility into invisible problems unlocks organizational action
- Becoming less technical, more business-fluent, was the right trade-off
- Iteration and singles over home runs

## Why I Left After 7 Years

I was given an opportunity to be the first product person ever at NewRez with a massive scope and impact potential. After seven years at Rocket, I had grown a lot but the next big growth opportunity was outside the company. NewRez offered a chance to shape product from the ground up rather than working within an established structure.

## The Rocket Growth Era

Rocket very much leaned into innovation with tech. We were often encouraged to learn about the latest and greatest technologies and find ways to incorporate them. It was an environment that rewarded curiosity and experimentation - you could pitch ideas, run pilots, and if something worked, it would scale fast. The speech analytics journey from 50 bankers to 3,000 was a direct result of that culture.

## Projects That Didn't Make the Resume

The Salesforce migration story didn't get full appreciation on the resume, but it was a significant project. The client services team was navigating 20+ applications at any given time. When a customer called, a rep might have to touch 5 to 10 different systems in a single conversation. I led the discovery for client services and operations - mapping the pain points of "20 apps in one call" into a future state design for the consulting companies building the solution. It was foundational work that shaped how 400 team members would eventually work.
