# Product Party - Founder & Newsletter Creator

**Duration:** Dec 2023 - Present

## Why I Started This

I've always loved writing. And I've loved consuming content around product management for a long time. At some point I thought: maybe I could merge the two loves together.

So I started a newsletter.

## What I Write About

I do a lot of research into what's popular from a topic perspective. Over the last year, a few themes have been especially important:

- The emerging differences in the product space
- The impacts of AI on product management
- How AI is leading to the blending of engineering and traditional PM roles
- What all of this means from a career perspective

That last point is also why I'm building this portfolio bot. The landscape is shifting, and I want to be part of the conversation about where it's going.

## How It Grew

The 2,000+ subscribers came mostly organically. Some growth came through the Substack platform itself and being connected to other creators who are growing. No paid promotion - just consistent publishing and participating in the community.

## The Goal Right Now

The goal isn't monetization (at least not yet). It's about:

1. **Creating community** - finding other people going through similar situations
2. **Building in public** - I'm shipping a lot of software and want a forum to show it off and get feedback
3. **Finding my people** - connecting with others who are doing something similar

If something resonates with someone, that's the win.

## What I've Learned

Writing regularly has taught me a few things:

**It's hard to get people to care.** You can't expect everyone to jump on what you're writing. That expectation will break you.

**Write for yourself first.** If you're only writing for the audience, you'll burn out or lose your voice.

**Pick up on feedback signals.** Pay attention to what resonates and what doesn't. Evolve your content to fit the growth pattern that feels right to you.

**Consistency compounds.** Showing up weekly matters more than any single post.
