# Credit Acceptance - Senior Product Owner

**Duration:** Sep 2022 - Mar 2025 (2.5 years)

## The Product Org When I Joined

The product organization was great when I joined. My scope was focused on building out the Dealer Test Drive program - something new to the organization that enabled dealers to try our main product without any commitment. It was a fundamental change in the way we did business.

Not long after I started, the product team turned over with new leadership. They started building the team they wanted, so there was a lot of change. I was hired as a Senior Product Manager but the title changed to Senior Product Owner - though the roles were essentially the same.

## The Dealer Test Drive Story

The underperforming states were mostly about dealers' lack of wanting to commit to us. The traditional sales model required commitment upfront, which created friction.

We used A/B testing to iterate on solutions that worked around our own internal rigorous process. The idea: let dealers try our product, see if they liked it, then lean in to get them to sign up if they enjoyed it.

It worked. 33% enrollment increase in underperforming states, which led to a nationwide rollout across 450+ dealerships.

**The lesson:** Sometimes the product is fine - it's the barrier to trying it that's the problem.

## The Oracle CRM Modernization

The Oracle CRM was painful. Very antiquated look and feel. The team was solid, but they never really made changes unless business leaders asked - and those requests usually weren't vetted the way a product manager would.

I started phasing in product techniques: sessions with salespeople to understand their biggest pain points, rapid iterations on the UI. Over time, we transformed it into something much more usable for the new version.

10% improvement in quarterly user satisfaction scores - not flashy, but meaningful when you're dealing with a tool people use all day.

## Waterfall to Agile

The company moved slowly. Historically it was "business leader has an idea, the team figures out how to deliver it." There was desire to move to Agile, but no one had really operationalized it.

Since I'd only ever worked in an Agile way, I pretty quickly identified ways to help the teams I was working with day-to-day. We pulled in agile fundamentals incrementally - not a big transformation announcement, just practical changes that helped them deliver more rapidly.

Three teams moved from waterfall to Agile methodology with JIRA workflows, optimized backlogs, and sprint ceremonies.

## What Made This Role Valuable

I enjoyed working with many of the people there and had great opportunities to meet different customers in the field. Getting out of the office and seeing how dealers actually used our products shaped how I thought about the CRM work.
