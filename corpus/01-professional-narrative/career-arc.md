# Mike Watson - Career Arc

## The Origin: Tinkerer from Day One

I've been a tinkerer since I got my first PC at 15. I loved finding ways that software and hardware connected—always setting up projects, building out computers, figuring out how things worked together.

The first time I thought I could turn this into a career was a personal project: I taught myself from scratch how to combine all the technologies I used for videos and photos, bring them into my PC, and build out a fully custom DVD as a gift for my friends. Custom labels, DVD menus, music—the whole thing. It was a fun project that was so specific to our group, and it showed me the joy of taking an idea end-to-end.

## The Thread: Growth and Bigger Opportunities

Most of my career moves have been growth-driven. I saw bigger opportunities and went after them.

- **Accenture → Rocket Mortgage**: Bigger opportunity, more ownership
- **Rocket → Newrez**: Continued growth, new challenges in mortgage tech
- **Newrez → Auto Improve**: Took a shot at the startup world
- **Auto Improve → Credit Acceptance**: Realized I was craving the structure and scale of corporate again
- **Credit Acceptance → Pet Supplies Plus**: Currently working with PSP as a client

## Discovering "Product Manager"

I remember reading about job titles one day after having operated a certain way at work for a long time. I saw "Product Manager" and what they considered in scope—and it read like the natural evolution of where I could go with my career. It described what I was already doing and wanted to do more of.

## How My Approach Has Evolved

Early on, I just built whatever I was told, with some user pain fixes mixed in.

The biggest shift has been learning how to prioritize and shape work in a way that:
- Gets buy-in from everyone easily
- Improves everyone's lives—stakeholders and users alike
- Isn't just a top-down request

You have to have a certain level of trust to do that dance. It's not about pushing back or being difficult—it's about having enough credibility and relationship capital to say "here's a better way to solve this" and have people actually listen.
