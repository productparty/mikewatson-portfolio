# Accenture - Analyst

**Duration:** Jan 2011 - Jun 2013 (2.5 years)

## How I Got Here

I was underemployed for almost 2 years during the last recession, trying to find my first career job. I interviewed with Accenture not long after I finished my master's degree, hoping it would be something where I could travel and build my career.

It was.

## The Global Scheduling Platform

I was part of a small team of five people that built a help desk in India to schedule cross-platform, cross-technology video conferences for senior leadership globally - both within the Fortune 500 client and between Accenture and their customers.

Since I had never done anything like that before, it was fantastic. I was heavily involved in designing the flow and coaching/training the call center team. I still keep in touch with people I worked with on that project.

**The lesson:** You don't need deep experience to contribute meaningfully. What matters is being willing to figure it out.

## The Excel Automation Story

There were 16 different workstreams on this major SAP implementation, with a thousand-line project plan living in Excel. Every week, each workstream lead would update their relevant lines. Then they'd pass it to my boss, who would manually update the master list line by line from each of those groups.

I built a VBA tool that changed everything:
- Each team lead could click a button to export a slimmed-down version of their changes
- From my perspective, I could click one button to absorb all the changes and update the master file

1,000+ hours saved through automation of something that was just... tedious manual work that nobody questioned until someone did.

## What Consulting Taught Me

Things I still carry today:

1. **Accuracy of metrics matters.** If your numbers are wrong, decisions are wrong.
2. **Driving delivery requires intensity.** Sometimes you have to push hard to get people to deliver.
3. **Resourcefulness.** Think outside the box when solving problems. The answer isn't always obvious.

Consulting also taught me how large organizations actually work - the politics, the stakeholders, the pace of change. That foundation has helped in every role since.

## Why I Left

I wanted to stop traveling. Rocket Mortgage was in downtown Detroit - local - and had a great culture. It was the right move at the right time.

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed and launched global scheduling platform for Fortune 500 client with 250,000+ employees
- Established 15-person call center in India with complete training and documentation framework
- Automated Excel-based workflows for 16-workstream SAP implementation, saving 1,000+ hours
- Built automated project reporting system in SharePoint for 300-person SAP project

## What This Role Taught Me

- You don't need experience to figure things out - just willingness
- Automation of tedious work is almost always worth the upfront investment
- Metrics accuracy and delivery intensity are non-negotiable in large organizations
- Training others scales your impact far beyond what you can do alone
