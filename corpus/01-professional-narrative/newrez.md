# Newrez - Digital Product Manager

**Duration:** Nov 2020 - Jul 2021 (8 months)

## Why I Took This Role

After 7+ years at Rocket, I wanted to find an opportunity where I could be the first product manager in an organization that didn't have a product team. The appeal was taking the lessons I'd learned at Rocket and bringing them into another mortgage company that was quite far behind in technology.

## The 21 Brands Reality

21 mortgage brands sounds wild, but the landing page was white-labeled for the most part. Many pages had very similar fields and organization - really just color scheme and slight variations. But it's still 21 businesses that all rely on this one product to operate. When something breaks, 21 different stakeholders care.

## The BBB Complaint Story

The 33% complaint reduction came from rebuilding the login process. Early on we didn't have great telemetry, but we did have those BBB complaints - they were a signal. Once we implemented proper telemetry, we confirmed what the complaints suggested: people really struggled with login.

The same login was used by the mobile app, which had tons of terrible reviews because of it. The complaints and app reviews painted a clear picture before we even had the data to prove it.

**The lesson:** Sometimes your data is hiding in customer complaints and 1-star reviews. You don't always need perfect analytics to know where the pain is.

## The Regulatory Sprint

The one-month regulatory deadline across all 21 brands was a heavy coordination effort. I had to step out of my product management skills and go straight project management and facilitation. When you have that many stakeholders and a hard deadline, the job becomes making sure everybody is talking and nothing falls through the cracks.

## Why I Left After 8 Months

I was excited to be part of an emerging product management team, but my personal interest was to go even more foundational - to be part of a startup where I could leverage my skills but build from scratch.

Auto Approve offered that. I joined as tech employee number two.

## Key Accomplishments

- 10% lead conversion increase across 21 mortgage brands through form optimization and user journey mapping
- 33% BBB complaint reduction by identifying and fixing the broken login flow
- Delivered regulatory compliance update for company-wide landing pages within one-month deadline
- Managed an 800,000-user platform

## What This Role Taught Me

- Customer complaints are data, especially when you don't have telemetry yet
- Sometimes the PM job is actually project management and that's fine
- White-label products multiply complexity in ways that aren't obvious until something breaks
