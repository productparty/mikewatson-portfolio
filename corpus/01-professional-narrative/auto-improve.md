# Auto Improve - Senior Product Manager

**Duration:** Jul 2021 - Sep 2022 (14 months)

## The "Tech Employee #2" Reality

Being tech employee #2 in a startup that was already 350 people large was interesting. The company didn't have an internal tech team - I needed to work with tech partners who owned delivery and most of the technology stack.

By the time I left, my scope had expanded significantly. I went from owning a slice of the in-house CRM to running the decision and prioritization for ALL legacy running-the-business technology. The company had started a new project to rebuild the whole platform, and all internal focus was on that future state - while I worked with several offshore partners to deliver any technology changes the business needed today.

## The E-Notary Story (3,000% Growth)

The e-notary feature technically worked... sometimes. But it was so inconsistent and poorly designed from a UX perspective that team members never used it. The capability existed on paper, but not in practice.

I did interviews. I watched people try to use the tool. I walked through the flows myself. What I found were pretty simple problems - confusing steps, unclear error states, friction points that made people give up. The fixes weren't technically complex, but they required someone to actually sit down and identify them.

Once we fixed the flow, adoption grew exponentially over the next few months. The lesson: sometimes the feature is fine, but the path to using it is broken.

## The Intercom/Chatbot Launch

I didn't actually identify Intercom as the solution. I was told "hey, this is a technology we're going to do - can you build it?"

Since I'd worked with bots in the past (Rocket Mortgage chatbot experience), I adapted quickly. I learned how it all worked, built out all the conversation flows, trained up the team members to use it, and saw it launch across all public-facing websites.

We onboarded 5 team members as chat agents in addition to their day-to-day work. First month: 2,500 fewer calls and emails hitting the customer service team.

**The lesson:** Being adaptable matters more than being the one with the idea. Someone handed me a tool; I figured out how to make it work.

## The Three-Vendor Chaos

There were three different development vendors, each brought in based on different IT leadership decisions and relationships. They were trying to find the best fit, so as new tech teams accumulated, each came with their own request systems and backlogs.

My job was to streamline all of them - get everyone into one JIRA, one source of truth, one way of working. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was necessary to get the most out of what we had.

## Why I Left

I had an opportunity to join a well-established product team at Credit Acceptance - a local company (even though they were remote). I knew they had great past coworkers there, and I was ready to be part of a more mature product organization after building from scratch.

## Key Accomplishments

- Launched Intercom chat and AI chatbot, reducing inbound volume by 2,500 calls/emails in the first month
- Grew e-notary adoption 3,000%+ through UX research and flow fixes
- Consolidated three vendor engineering backlogs into unified JIRA system
- Expanded from single product owner to running all legacy business technology decisions

## What This Role Taught Me

- Sometimes the feature works; the path to using it is what's broken
- Being adaptable is more valuable than being the one with the original idea
- Offshore partner management is its own skillset - you can't just throw requirements over the wall
- "Tech employee #2" in a non-tech company means you become the translator for everything
