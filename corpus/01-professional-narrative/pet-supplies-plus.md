# Pet Supplies Plus - Senior Product Manager

**Duration:** Apr 2025 - Present (Contract)

## The Role

The role is technically part product manager, part project manager. There's no dedicated product management function at the company, so I'm filling both gaps - running strategic initiatives while bringing product discipline to how work gets planned and tracked.

## The Situation When I Arrived

The company had no IT development visibility, no metrics, no consistent methods across teams. Everyone just did work and told each other when it was done. There was no way to tell the story of how a project was going from a health perspective, and no framework for executives to make decisions or understand status in a simple way.

## What I'm Running

I'm currently running several of the biggest initiatives within the company:

1. **The #1 initiative from last year** - in the process of rolling out to all stores
2. **A major pricing initiative** - going live within weeks, continuing through the rest of the half-year

Both are significant to the business and require coordinating across multiple teams.

## What I Brought

Pretty traditional project management stuff - but it didn't exist there:
- Structured intake process and 2-week sprint cadence in JIRA
- Health perspective on project status
- Facilitation of executive conversations so they could make decisions
- Simple visibility into what's happening and what's blocked

Nothing revolutionary, but foundational. Sometimes the value is just bringing discipline to chaos.

## The Broader Context

The product market has been tough. This role was an opportunity to stay engaged while building toward what's next - including this portfolio bot.

There's no product management function here, so I'm bringing what I can while hoping to get as many of my projects live as possible during my time.

## Key Accomplishments

- Running the company's top strategic initiatives including last year's #1 priority
- Implemented structured intake process and 2-week sprint cadence in JIRA
- Built executive reporting dashboard tracking delivery health and team capacity
- Established predictable delivery rhythm across multiple product teams

## What This Role Is Teaching Me

- Sometimes the job is bringing discipline where there was none
- Hybrid PM/project manager roles exist in companies without mature product orgs
- Even "traditional" project management adds real value when it's missing entirely
