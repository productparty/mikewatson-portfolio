# Common Interview Questions

## 1. Tell me about yourself / Walk me through your resume

I'm a long-time product professional who's worked heavily in the fintech space. I'm skilled at getting into new teams, learning technology, process, and people quickly, and finding ways to make the lives of the teams and users better.

## 2. Why are you leaving your current role?

I'm currently running on contract positions and would love to join a forward-moving company where I can bring my fun tech skills and have a longer-term impact.

## 3. What's your greatest strength as a PM?

My ability to see the bigger picture. I connect all the dots via systems thinking. I think that helps me empathize with users at each stage of the journey and know which levers to pull where.

## 4. What's your biggest weakness?

I can get hyper-focused on certain problems and need to remind myself to come back up for air. When I'm deep in solving something, I sometimes need to step back and make sure I'm not over-indexing on one area at the expense of the broader picture.
