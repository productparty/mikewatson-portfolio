# Stakeholder Management

## How I Build Trust

I build trust with stakeholders by understanding their problems, motivations, and the problem they're trying to solve. I do that by investing time in the relationship.

It's not about just showing up when you need something. You have to genuinely understand what's driving them, what pressures they're under, and what success looks like from their seat.

## Handling Conflicts

When there are conflicts between stakeholders, I try to lay out all the facts and get them to come to consensus.

The key is getting everyone looking at the same information. Most conflicts come from people having different assumptions or incomplete pictures. When you get the facts on the table, reasonable people can usually find a path forward.

## Principles

- **Invest in relationships before you need them**: Build trust during calm times so you have credibility when things get tough.
- **Understand their "why"**: Every stakeholder has pressures and motivations. Know what they are.
- **Facts over opinions**: When there's conflict, ground the conversation in data and shared reality.
- **Facilitate consensus, don't force it**: Your job is to help people see the same picture, not to pick winners and losers.
