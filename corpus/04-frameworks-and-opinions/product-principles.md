# Product Principles

Core beliefs about how product work should be done.

## The Singles Philosophy

**"Win the baseball game with many singles."**

You don't need home runs. Most successful product work is accumulated through consistent, incremental wins. Small improvements that compound. Features that solve real problems without trying to be revolutionary.

The people who only swing for home runs often strike out. The people who consistently get on base are the ones who win.

## Sometimes the Product is Fine

**"Sometimes the product is fine - it's the path to using it that's broken."**

This shows up constantly:
- The e-notary feature worked, but the UX was so confusing nobody used it
- The login flow was functional, but people couldn't get through it
- The dealer program was good, but the commitment barrier killed conversion

Before rebuilding a feature, ask: is the feature the problem, or is it the friction around it?

## Complaints Are Data

**"Customer complaints are data, especially when you don't have telemetry yet."**

BBB complaints, 1-star reviews, support tickets - these tell you what's broken before your analytics dashboard does. When you're at a company without great instrumentation, listen to the noise.

The app store reviews and BBB complaints showed the login was broken. The data just confirmed what the complaints already said.

## Understand Users > Technical Depth

**"Most of us are as technical as we need to be at that moment in time."**

You can devote all your waking hours to the latest certifications, but if you consistently produce products that leave users unsatisfied because you didn't understand their needs, will you still feel good about your work?

Technical skills matter. But understanding your users deeply is harder to fake and more valuable.

## The 70% Rule

**Make decisions with about 70% of the information you ideally want.**

Waiting for complete information leads to delays and missed opportunities. Being decisive with substantial but incomplete data - and staying flexible to course-correct - is how you move fast without being reckless.

This aligns with agile: iterate, get feedback, improve. Don't over-analyze.

## Don't Turn Engineers Into Order-Takers

**"Most software engineers chose their career path because they love solving problems."**

If you come in hot with your technical solutions, you risk curbing their creativity and desire to work with you. Listen first. Build mutual trust. Then figure out how to support the team together.

The goal is collaboration, not compliance.

## Get Into the Field

**"Getting into the field with customers beats assumptions every time."**

At Credit Acceptance, visiting dealers in person shaped how I thought about the CRM work. Watching real users struggle with real problems is worth more than a hundred stakeholder interviews.

## Reassess Value Continuously

Has the value of what you're building changed since you started?

Market shifts, competitor announcements, company pivots - all of these can change whether your feature is still worth shipping. Check in regularly. Don't build something that was valuable six months ago but isn't anymore.
