# Adaptability

Why being adaptable matters more than being the originator.

## You Don't Need the Original Idea

**"Being adaptable is more valuable than being the one with the original idea."**

At Auto Approve, I didn't identify Intercom as the solution. I was told "hey, this is a technology we're going to do - can you build it?"

I adapted quickly. Built the conversation flows, trained the team, launched it across all public-facing websites. First month: 2,500 fewer calls and emails.

Someone handed me a tool. I figured out how to make it work. That's the skill.

## Willingness > Experience

**"You don't need deep experience to contribute meaningfully. What matters is being willing to figure it out."**

At Accenture, I was part of a small team that built a global scheduling platform. I'd never done anything like it before. But I was willing to learn, design the flows, train the call center team.

Still keep in touch with people from that project.

## Resourcefulness and Thinking Outside the Box

Consulting taught me this: when you're trying to solve a problem, the answer isn't always obvious. You have to think creatively, try different approaches, and not give up when the first attempt fails.

The VBA tool that saved 1,000+ hours at Accenture? Nobody asked for that. I saw tedious manual work and thought "there has to be a better way."

## Tech Employee #2

Being tech employee #2 in a 350-person company meant working with offshore partners, managing vendor chaos, and figuring out how to get technology changes done without an internal engineering team.

By the end, I went from owning a slice of the CRM to running decisions for all legacy business technology.

The job kept expanding because I kept adapting.

## Quick to Learn New Tools

Whether it's speech analytics, e-notary platforms, chatbot builders, or AI coding assistants - the pattern is the same:
1. Get handed a new tool
2. Learn how it works
3. Figure out how to make it valuable
4. Ship it

The specific technology matters less than the ability to pick it up and make it work.

## Adaptation in Content Creation

**"Write for yourself first. If you're only writing for the audience, you'll burn out or lose your voice."**

But also: pick up on feedback signals. Evolve your content to fit the growth pattern that feels right to you.

Adaptation applies to audience-building too. Pay attention to what resonates. Adjust accordingly.
