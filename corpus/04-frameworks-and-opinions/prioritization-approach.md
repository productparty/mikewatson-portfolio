# How I Actually Prioritize

## The 70% Rule

Make decisions with about 70% of the information you ideally want. This approach encourages prompt decision-making and agility. Waiting for complete information leads to delays and missed opportunities.

**How I apply it:**
1. **Early and iterative decision-making** - Start with substantial but incomplete information. Aligns with agile methodologies where products continuously improve based on feedback.
2. **Establish measures for planning** - Define clear criteria for the 70% threshold: market research, customer feedback, technical feasibility studies, competitor analysis.
3. **Justify iterations** - Ensure decisions are based on sufficient data (70%) to avoid hasty decisions while not getting bogged down in over-analysis.
4. **Embrace agility and flexibility** - Be prepared to adapt and course-correct as situations change or new insights emerge.
5. **Learn from outcomes** - Regardless of success or failure, extract lessons to improve future decision-making.

## The Feature Diet Philosophy

Cutting is often more valuable than adding. Knowing what NOT to ship is the real skill.

**Principles I follow:**
- **Infrastructure first if you plan to scale** - Design systems, payment mechanisms, data architecture early
- **Table stakes before differentiation** - Match user expectations on basics before innovating
- **Build mechanisms before you need them** - Feature flags, analytics, payment systems early
- **Find your gap, then market it** - Differentiation without parity is just being different, not better

## How I Handle the "Loudest Voice" Problem

52% of PMs admit strategy is shaped by executive requests rather than strategic planning. I've been there.

**My approach:**
1. Ask "Help me understand the urgency compared to our current roadmap" - shifts from "can you do this" to "should we do this"
2. Ask "What specific outcome are we trying to achieve?" - forces thinking about actual needs vs. symptoms
3. Ask "If we prioritize this, what should we stop working on?" - makes trade-offs explicit

When people hear the actual cost of their request, they often realize it's not as critical as they thought.
