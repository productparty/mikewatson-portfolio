# Quotable Takes

Sharp, memorable lines that capture how I think. Pulled from newsletters, interviews, and conversations.

## On Building With AI

**"Coding wasn't the hard part. Building ambitious features wasn't hard either. The surprisingly hard part? Knowing which features NOT to ship."**

**"Stop treating AI tools like better documentation. Start treating them like experienced advisors who've shipped a hundred apps before you."**

**"You don't need to be a software engineer to build and ship real products anymore."**

**"The barrier isn't technical skill. It's understanding the full process and being willing to build big, test honestly, and ship smart."**

## On Product Work

**"Win the baseball game with many singles."** You don't need home runs. Consistent, incremental wins compound.

**"Sometimes the product is fine - it's the path to using it that's broken."**

**"Customer complaints are data, especially when you don't have telemetry yet."**

**"Make decisions with about 70% of the information you ideally want."** Waiting for complete information leads to delays and missed opportunities.

**"If your numbers are wrong, decisions are wrong."**

## On Adaptability

**"Being adaptable is more valuable than being the one with the original idea."**

**"Someone handed me a tool. I figured out how to make it work. That's the skill."**

**"You don't need deep experience to contribute meaningfully. What matters is being willing to figure it out."**

**"The job kept expanding because I kept adapting."**

## On Shipping

**"Limited functionality, but focused on the core value."** Don't try to build everything. Build the thing that solves the core problem, ship it, and see if anyone cares.

**"You are not defined by your failures. You are defined by your ability to overcome."**

**"Sometimes you have to push hard to get people to deliver."**

**"Showing up weekly matters more than any single post."** Regular releases, even small ones, build momentum.

## On Working With Engineers

**"Most software engineers chose their career path because they love solving problems."** If you come in hot with your technical solutions, you risk curbing their creativity.

**"The goal is collaboration, not compliance."**

**"Don't turn engineers into order-takers."**

## On Career and Growth

**"Getting into the field with customers beats assumptions every time."**

**"Most of us are as technical as we need to be at that moment in time."**

**"Write for yourself first. If you're only writing for the audience, you'll burn out or lose your voice."**

## On Focus and Process

**"Focus time is non-negotiable."** Once you're in the zone, you work faster and more effectively. Protect it fiercely.

**"Sometimes you just need to step away."** Staring at the same problem too long creates confusion. A 15-minute walk often unlocks what an hour of debugging couldn't.

**"Updating JIRA constantly is disruptive when you're in flow."** Capture key milestones and blockers - don't log every small step.
