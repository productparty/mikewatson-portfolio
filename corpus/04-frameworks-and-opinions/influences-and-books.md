# Influences and Books

## Five Books That Shaped My Career

### 1. "The Speed of Trust" by Stephen M.R. Covey
How trust is the foundation that makes everything run smoothly. When trust is high, things happen faster, decisions are made more easily, and the team stays in sync. This book helped me realize how much effort to invest in building trust upfront. It pays dividends.

### 2. "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr
Framework for setting measurable goals through OKRs. It helps me keep the team aligned on what success looks like and ensures we're always aiming for impact. The key discipline: "How will we know if this is working?"

### 3. "Wait: The Art and Science of Delay" by Frank Partnoy
The value of slowing down before making decisions. This changed my approach to launches—I now ask "Is now the right time? Do we have all the information we need?" Patience leads to better outcomes.

### 4. "Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know" by Adam Grant
The importance of rethinking beliefs and decisions. Adam Grant's focus on intellectual humility—being willing to change your mind—has had a big impact on me. It encourages questioning assumptions and actively seeking feedback that challenges your thinking.

### 5. "Laws of UX" by Jon Yablonski
Practical UX design principles. I would never pretend to be an expert in UX/UI, but this book simplified complex principles in a way that stuck with me. It doesn't just stay in theory—it gives clear advice on creating designs people enjoy using.

## Thought Leaders I Follow

- **Deepak Deolalikar** (Product Operating System) - Sharp thinking on technical depth requirements for PMs
- **Will Lawrence** (Product Life) - Great content on "becoming default essential" as a product person

## Why These Matter

I'm drawn to books and thinkers who are practical, not theoretical. I want frameworks I can actually use, not abstract principles that sound good but don't translate to real work. Every book on this list changed how I operate day-to-day.
