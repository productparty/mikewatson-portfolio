# AI and Product Management

My evolving perspective on how AI is reshaping the product landscape.

## The Blending of Roles

**AI is leading to the blending of engineering and traditional product management.**

This is one of the most significant shifts happening right now. The lines are blurring between who writes code and who defines what gets built. PMs who can prototype, test, and ship without waiting for engineering are in a different position than those who can't.

This is why I'm building this portfolio bot. The landscape is shifting, and I want to be part of the conversation about where it's going.

## You Don't Need to Be a Software Engineer

**"You don't need to be a software engineer to build and ship real products anymore."**

I've proven this with Leafed (iOS/Android app), the HVAC calculator, and multiple other projects. Using Cursor and Claude, I've written the vast majority of the code for products that are live in app stores and being used by real people.

The tools have gotten good enough that if you can think through the problem and communicate what you want, you can build it.

## The Hybrid Skillset

**"If you're a PM who can navigate both technical and business conversations, you're in high demand."**

Companies are looking for hybrid professionals who can bridge both worlds. Roles like "Technical Product Manager" and "Product Owner with Coding Experience" aren't just trendy titles - they're shaping the future of product development.

This doesn't mean you need to become a full-stack engineer. But understanding:
- How to communicate with engineering teams
- How to make informed trade-off decisions
- How to prototype ideas quickly

...these are becoming table stakes.

## Low-Code/No-Code Won't Replace Developers

**Developers are more valuable than ever.**

The myth is that these tools will replace developers. The reality: developers' roles are evolving to focus on complex problem-solving, architectural decisions, and mentorship.

Low-code tools let PMs handle basic development tasks, which frees engineers to prioritize strategic projects. That's a win for everyone.

## Building in Public

I'm shipping a lot of software publicly. The goal is to:
- Have a forum to show it off and get feedback
- Connect with others doing similar things
- Prove that non-developers can ship real products

This is also about understanding what my engineering partners go through. Running my own projects with JIRA, CI/CD, and production deployments has given me new appreciation for the complexity involved.

## What I've Learned Building With AI

**Realization #1: Focus time is non-negotiable.**
Once you're in the zone, you work faster and more effectively. Protect it fiercely.

**Realization #2: Sometimes you just need to step away.**
Staring at the same problem too long creates confusion. A 15-minute walk often unlocks what an hour of debugging couldn't.

**Realization #3: Process overhead is real.**
Updating JIRA constantly is disruptive when you're in flow. Capture key milestones and blockers - don't log every small step.

## The Future of PM

The product managers who thrive will be the ones who can:
- Use AI tools to accelerate prototyping and testing
- Bridge technical and business conversations
- Ship ideas without waiting for full development cycles
- Adapt as the role continues to evolve

The landscape is shifting fast. The only losing move is standing still.
