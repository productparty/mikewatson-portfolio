# Agile Transformation

## My Experience at Credit Acceptance

Credit Acceptance was waterfall when I arrived. By the end of my time there, we had implemented some organizational agile practices, but it was slow to roll out company-wide. However, the teams I worked with directly—I was able to get them adopted quickly.

The difference was hands-on involvement and making it real for people, not just announcing a new process.

## My Philosophy on Agile

My big thing with agile is that you need to not do things just to say you do them.

Meetings like grooming must have the right people focused on the most important work to be delivered. If you're running ceremonies just to check a box, you're wasting everyone's time and breeding cynicism about the process.

Agile should make teams faster and more responsive—not add overhead. If it's not doing that, something's wrong with the implementation, not the methodology.

## Principles

- **Substance over ceremony**: Don't do agile theater. Every meeting should have a clear purpose and the right people in the room.
- **Start with willing teams**: Get early adopters moving first, then let success spread.
- **Focus on outcomes**: Agile is a means to an end—shipping better products faster. Keep that as the north star.
- **Right-size the process**: Not every team needs the same level of ceremony. Adapt to what works.
