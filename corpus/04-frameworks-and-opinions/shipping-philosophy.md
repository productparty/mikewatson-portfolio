# Shipping Philosophy

How I think about getting things out the door.

## Ship Something Useful, See If There's Traction

**"Limited functionality, but focused on the core value."**

This was the philosophy behind the HVAC calculator. Don't try to build everything. Build the thing that solves the core problem, ship it, and see if anyone cares.

If there's traction, you can expand. If there's not, you haven't wasted months on features no one wanted.

## Fail and Iterate

**"You are not defined by your failures. You are defined by your ability to overcome."**

My biggest product failure was a speech analytics tool that nobody used. We built something great - but it didn't match what the team actually needed. The fix: start smaller, work with the actual users, let them help lead the change.

Second launch to 50 salespeople went great. Then we scaled to 2,000 team members.

The lesson: don't settle for failure. Look for the positives, find ways to improve, push forward.

## When to Ship

Before launching, ask yourself:

1. **How realistic is scaling?** If this works, what does phase two look like? Start those conversations early.

2. **Has the value changed since you started?** Market shifts, competitor moves, company pivots - reassess whether this is still the right thing to build.

3. **What are the risks?** Legal/compliance concerns? Potential to completely disrupt user experience? Ability to revert if things go wrong?

If any of these are show-stoppers, address them before green-lighting. Moving forward despite major red flags is costly.

## Agile Transformation is Practical, Not Theoretical

**"Agile transformation works better as practical changes than big announcements."**

At Credit Acceptance, I helped three teams move from waterfall to agile. Not through a big transformation initiative, but by identifying quick wins with the teams I was working with day-to-day.

Pull in fundamentals incrementally. Show results. Let the change spread.

## Driving Delivery Requires Intensity

**"Sometimes you have to push hard to get people to deliver."**

Consulting taught me this. When there's a deadline and multiple stakeholders, the job becomes facilitation and accountability. Make sure everyone is talking. Make sure nothing falls through the cracks.

This isn't glamorous, but it's essential.

## Accuracy of Metrics Matters

**"If your numbers are wrong, decisions are wrong."**

One of the core lessons from consulting that I still carry. When you're tracking progress, health, or outcomes - the data has to be right. Wrong metrics lead to wrong decisions.

## Sometimes the PM Job is Project Management

**"Sometimes the job is just bringing discipline where there was none."**

At Pet Supplies Plus, the company had no IT development visibility, no metrics, no consistent methods. Bringing in JIRA, sprint cadence, and executive dashboards wasn't revolutionary - it was foundational.

Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes the value is discipline, not innovation.

## Consistency Compounds

**"Showing up weekly matters more than any single post."**

This applies to newsletters, but also to shipping. Regular releases, even small ones, build momentum. Teams that ship frequently develop the muscle memory for delivery.

The goal isn't one big launch. It's the habit of shipping.
