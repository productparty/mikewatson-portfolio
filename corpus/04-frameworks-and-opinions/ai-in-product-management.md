# My Take on AI in Product Management

## Core Position

**Adopt AI for efficiency, not for thinking.**

AI is a force multiplier for getting things done faster—not a replacement for human judgment. Our job isn't just to ship features; it's to solve human problems in human ways. AI can help you move faster, but you still need to bring the "why" and the empathy.

Non-developers can now build and ship real products with AI tools. I've proven this myself. The barrier to entry for turning ideas into working software has never been lower. If you have an idea and you're willing to work through problems with AI as your co-pilot, you can build it.

AI governance is becoming a critical PM skill. As AI gets embedded into more products, PMs need to understand the ethical implications, data privacy concerns, and guardrails required to ship responsibly.

## What I've Actually Built With AI

- **Leafed** - A plant care app built using AI-assisted development
- **HVAC Savings Calculator** - A tool for homeowners to estimate savings, built with Claude/Cursor
- **AI Chat Anchor** - This portfolio site's AI chatbot you're talking to right now
- **Meow Game** - A simple web game I built with ChatGPT/GPT-4 and Midjourney to prove that non-developers can ship real products with AI assistance

I've written about my experience building apps with ChatGPT, walking through ideation, development, AWS deployment, and troubleshooting—all guided by AI. The whole point was to demonstrate that the "backlog imagineer" can become the builder.

## What I Think the Future Looks Like

I see an evolution where product, traditional software engineering, and QA start to blend into a singular world.

The most senior folks will help with big-picture guardrails—architecture decisions, strategic direction, quality standards. But the "doer" level will be expected to handle a wide variety of things in most organizations.

A new product role might be to just build and deploy your own UI bug fixes as an example. The lines between "I wrote the spec" and "I shipped the fix" are going to blur significantly.

This isn't about replacing specialists. It's about expanding what generalists can do with AI as their toolset.
