## Core Position
[TO BE FILLED VIA INTERVIEW]

Key themes from my writing:
- "Adopt AI for efficiency, not for thinking"
- "Our job isn't just to ship features; it's to solve human problems in human ways"
- Non-developers can build and ship real products with AI tools
- AI governance is becoming a critical PM skill
