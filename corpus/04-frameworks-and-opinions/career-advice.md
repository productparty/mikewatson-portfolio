# Career Advice for Product People

## Breaking Into Product

**Look for overlapping responsibilities.** Identify where your past experience aligns with product management responsibilities. Product intersects with marketing, engineering, sales, finance, operations, HR, R&D, legal, customer service, and IT. Find your angle.

**Use storytelling with examples and analogies.** Connect past success to product roles through concrete examples and memorable analogies. Don't just list skills—tell stories that show how you think.

**Target the right companies.** Mid-size firms and multinationals hire senior PMs more often (87% growth vs 16% for junior roles). Startups often prefer scrappier profiles. Know where your experience fits.

## Career Progression

**Your career progression is a web, not a ladder.** Build diverse experiences across functions and industries rather than climbing a single domain. The most interesting PMs I know have zigzag careers.

**Become default essential.** Strong employees should think about becoming default essential. Not only will this make your job safer, but it will also demonstrate that you are a committed leader with a strong strategic sense.

## Common Mistakes I See

**Underinvesting in relationships.** Build relationships with coworkers early, especially those you'll work with most. These relationships pay dividends when getting things done. You can't just show up when you need something.

**Overthinking technical depth.** You don't need to be deeply technical for most PM roles. Technical depth varies by product type. Understanding user needs and business impact matters more. Unless your engineering team needs it, constantly being technical runs the risk of curbing their creativity and desire to work with you.

**Chasing the title instead of the work.** Focus on doing PM work wherever you are—even if your title doesn't say "Product Manager" yet. The work matters more than the label.

## What Makes Someone "Senior"

It's not years of experience. It's:
- The ability to shape work so it gets buy-in easily
- Knowing when to push back and having the credibility to do it
- Making trade-offs explicit instead of pretending you can do everything
- Building trust before you need it
- Seeing the bigger picture and connecting dots others miss
