# Key Themes in My Writing

This document captures the recurring themes across Product Party and Mike's other writing.

## 1. Feature Diet Philosophy

**Core argument:** Less is more. The most valuable product decisions often involve what you choose NOT to build. 64% of features are rarely or never used, yet teams keep adding more while user satisfaction plateaus.

**Key supporting stories:**
- Inherited a backlog "so dense it practically needed its own zip code" - spent three weeks reviewing everything, and the most valuable outcome was realizing what we could confidently abandon
- Created the "Feature Sunset Scorecard" framework with five dimensions: Usage Frequency, User Impact, Maintenance Cost, Strategic Alignment, and Opportunity Cost

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "You Should Join the Feature Diet"
- "Stop Shipping Features, Start Delivering Value"

**Quotable takes:**
- "Each zombie feature lingering in your product isn't just harmless digital furniture - it actively costs you money, focus, and development velocity."
- "In product management as in poetry, mastery manifests not in what you add, but in what you dare to remove."

## 2. Anti-Pattern Recognition in PM

**Core argument:** Breaking free from destructive patterns - particularly "feature factory syndrome" where we celebrate shipping features while forgetting to ask if anyone actually wants them.

**Key supporting stories:**
- The CRM dropdown debacle: Five meetings with senior sales leaders debating two dropdown menus. Result? Zero adoption once rolled out.
- Lead generation feature I was convinced would outperform existing tools - became emotionally attached, cherry-picked positive signals, should have walked away earlier

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "The Anti-Pattern Playbook"
- "Recognizing When It's Time to Pivot"

**Quotable takes:**
- "52% of product managers admit their strategy is primarily shaped by executive requests or direct customer feedback rather than strategic planning. We're not leading the product journey; we're frantically responding to the loudest voices in the room."
- "Not all organizations operate in the product management promised land we read about in Medium articles."

## 3. Building Products as a Non-Developer

**Core argument:** Low-code/no-code tools enable PMs to prototype and validate ideas without waiting for engineering. This isn't about replacing developers - it's about accelerating iteration and freeing engineers for strategic work.

**Key supporting stories:**
- Built Leafed, HVAC Calculator, AI Chat Anchor, and multiple Claude skills using AI-assisted development
- Weekend projects philosophy: take notes on ideas, download VS Code, connect GitHub Copilot, let it rip

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "The No-Code Revolution for Product Managers"
- "I Too Built an App with ChatGPT"
- "The Future of Software is Being Written by Non-Developers"

**Quotable takes:**
- "By 2025, 70% of new applications will be built using low-code/no-code platforms."
- "If you're a PM who can navigate both technical and business conversations, you're in high demand."

## 4. AI for Efficiency, Not for Thinking

**Core argument:** Use AI to amplify your capabilities and handle repetitive tasks, but don't outsource your judgment. The human elements - strategic thinking, stakeholder relationships, ethical considerations - can't be automated.

**Key supporting stories:**
- Built multiple AI-powered tools (Leafed, HVAC Calculator, AI Chat Anchor) to prove the concept
- Use AI daily for drafting, research, and code generation, but always apply human judgment to outputs

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "Practical Ways I Am Using AI Daily"
- "Should We Root for AI?"
- "Prompting Isn't the Skill Gap - Judgment Is"

**Quotable takes:**
- "Adopt AI for efficiency, not for thinking."
- "Prompting isn't the skill gap - judgment is."

## 5. The Messy Reality of Product Management

**Core argument:** PM work isn't the idealized version from blog posts. It's navigating disconnected stakeholders, political landmines, and imperfect information. Acknowledging this reality is the first step to thriving in it.

**Key supporting stories:**
- Sometimes you're stuck in "the desert of disconnected stakeholders, with only a CRM dropdown oasis that nobody visits"
- After you've given your absolute best effort to shift beliefs and practices, you need to make a clear-eyed assessment: stay or go

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "The Anti-Pattern Playbook"
- "Perfect Teams Don't Exist - That's the Point"
- "It Depends Isn't a Cop-Out"

**Quotable takes:**
- "Sometimes the MVP is simply building enough trust to get a seat at the table."
- "I've learned (the hard way) that not everyone and everything can change."

## 6. Career Development Without BS

**Core argument:** Practical, honest career advice based on real experience - not the sanitized LinkedIn version. Growth comes from doing hard things, building trust, and knowing when to move on.

**Key supporting stories:**
- Career moves driven by growth opportunities, not just compensation
- Discovered the title "Product Manager" after years of doing the work without the label
- Left Rocket after 7 years when growth opportunities plateaued

**Relevant newsletter posts:**
- "Five Books That Have Shaped My Career"
- "Don't Forget About Your Mental Health"
- "Finding Your Way: Modern Tools for the Modern Job Search"

**Quotable takes:**
- "Your corporate experience is startup gold."
- "Senior means you've been wrong enough times to know what right looks like."
