<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s that breaking down high-level work into smaller, actionable tasks is never as simple as it seems. </p><p>I used to believe that the more polished a plan was before sharing it with the dev team, the better. But then came <em>that</em> project - one where the fine print derailed the timeline because we hadn’t tapped into the dev team’s expertise early on. Since then, I’ve learned that early collaboration often prevents those costly mistakes.</p><p>This idea was reinforced when I read <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alex Debecker&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:15631346,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4878a22c-81c1-4576-ac6f-310436a98da5_3024x4032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;78cc3f8c-c6e9-4c68-bb00-0a0c37e10e4b&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> and his post on <em><a href="https://alexdebecker.substack.com/p/7-signs-of-scope-bloat-i-no-longer-ignore">7 Signs of Scope Bloat I No Longer Ignore</a></em>. It hit home because, like many product people, I’ve felt the pressure to have everything buttoned up before engaging with the development team. </p><p>But here’s what I’ve come to understand: getting developers involved early and often not only helps fill in the gaps you might have missed, but their insights can steer the project in ways you didn’t expect -

But, as I’ve learned, waiting until the plan is perfect can cause more harm than good. Even if the plan isn’t fully baked, sharing rough drafts invites the team to weigh in on technical feasibility early on. It also allows them to help fill in details you may have missed and highlight where decisions must be made.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create room for open dialogue.</strong><br>One of my favorite moments in product development is when a developer brings up a question or idea that hasn’t crossed my mind. These moments don’t happen if communication is one-sided. I’ve started approaching reviews and check-ins as status updates and open discussions. Letting the team challenge assumptions and propose alternative solutions has led to some of the most efficient and creative outcomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define success together.</strong><br>I often go into a project thinking I had the right success metrics mapped out. But after talking with the dev team, they’d highlight additional factors like performance impacts or scalability that should also be considered when defining success. Working together to align on what “good” looks like ensures everyone is rowing in the same direction.</p></li></ol><div class="install-substack-app-embed install-substack-app-embed-web" data-component-name="InstallSubstackAppToDOM"><img class="install-substack-app-embed-img" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66717693-4ad6-43ff-a01e-aeb440a56369_566x566.png"><div class="install-substack-app-embed-text"><div class="install-substack-app-header">Get more from Mike Watson in the Substack app</div><div class="install-substack-app-text">Available for iOS and Android</div></div><a href="https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_content=author-post-insert&amp;utm_source=productparty" target="_blank" class="install-substack-app-embed-link"><button class="install-substack-app-embed-btn button primary">Get the app</button></a></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>Why does this matter in product development?</strong></p><p>There's been a noticeable shift in the last couple of organizations I’ve worked with. We increasingly see the responsibilities once held by business analysts being absorbed by product owners. Business analysts were typically responsible for getting into the field-level details - those minor, granular work aspects vital to shaping the final product. However, this role is being phased out or significantly reduced in many organizations.</p><p>On the surface, this might seem like a disadvantage. With fewer people dedicated to those finer points, it’s easy to wonder whether some essential details could slip through the cracks. </p><p>But here’s the flip side: this shift allows software engineers and developers to step in and contribute creatively. Without rigid requirements or pre-defined solutions from a business analyst, developers can use their technical expertise to help shape how we achieve product objectives.</p><p>I’ve found that this new dynamic can lead to much more intelligent, more innovative solutions. Rather than being limited by overly detailed specs, dev teams now have the space to consider how best to achieve the product goals, often coming up with ideas that hadn’t crossed my mind during the initial planning phase. </p><p>It’s a shift that requires greater collaboration and trust between product and development teams, but when it works, it can lead to outcomes that are both technically sound and closely aligned with the product vision.</p><p>At its best, this collaborative approach delivers great products and fosters stronger relationships between teams, as everyone feels a sense of ownership and contribution toward the final outcome.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/p/your-developers-can-steer-you-right?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Product Party!
