<p>Ever found yourself trapped in the relentless cycle of building features that sound brilliant in planning meetings but somehow miss the mark in the real world? </p><p>Welcome to what I call "anti-pattern purgatory" – that peculiar place where good product intentions go to die.</p><p></p><p>The data paints a sobering picture: 52% of product managers admit their strategy is primarily shaped by executive requests or direct customer feedback rather than strategic planning. </p><p>We're not leading the product journey; we're frantically responding to the loudest voices in the room.</p><p></p><p>Let me share some thoughts on breaking free from these destructive anti-patterns – particularly the "feature factory syndrome," where we celebrate shipping features while forgetting to ask if anyone actually wants them.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Once we rolled it out, team members showed precisely zero interest in using these meticulously crafted dropdowns. </p><p>There wasn't even a good way to validate the data that did trickle in. </p><p>All that executive brain power, all those meetings, resulted in absolutely nothing of value.</p><p></p><p>That experience taught me a painful lesson about the disconnect between features and strategy. </p><p>Without a clear "why" that resonates beyond the meeting room, we risk creating digital ghost towns – technically impressive but practically useless.</p><p></p><p>This disconnect happens when we fail to establish and communicate a clear vision.

confusing project management with product management. </p><p>If you find yourself primarily focused on timelines, status updates, and keeping everyone "on the same page," you've likely slipped into project management mode.</p><p></p><p>According to the data, "Unfinished Tasks" ranks as the most prevalent anti-pattern in Scrum implementation, scoring 70.24% on this <a href="https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2023/drp/pdf/9562.pdf">Scrum related white paper</a>. </p><p>We're often so focused on delivery mechanics that we lose sight of the bigger picture.</p><p></p><p>While project management skills are valuable, product management requires a broader focus on user needs, market opportunities, and business outcomes. </p><p>The best PMs I know have strong project management capabilities but keep their primary focus on strategic product decisions.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Breaking Free: Practical Steps Forward</h2><p>So how do we escape these anti-patterns? Here are some approaches that have worked for me:</p><h4>1. Start with the "Why"</h4><p>For every feature request, ask "What problem are we solving?" at least three times to get to the root issue. The first answer is rarely the real one.</p><p></p><h4>2. Set Clear Success Metrics</h4><p>Define what success looks like before you build. If you can't measure it, you shouldn't build it.</p><p></p><h4>3. Challenge Your Assumptions</h4><p>Actively seek evidence that contradicts your feature ideas. The most valuable feedback often comes from users who disagree with you.</p><p></p><h4>4. Build Smaller, Learn Faster</h4><p>Break large initiatives into the smallest testable pieces. This allows you to validate assumptions before investing too deeply.</p><p></p><h4>5. Establish Partnerships with Stakeholders</h4><p>Over 50% of large product teams cite "keeping roadmaps and processes consistent" as their top growing pain.
