I’m excited about all the amazing things coming to market at the end of 2022. I firmly believe we will see dramatic changes that will improve our daily lives while limiting disruptions and keeping our families safe.  </p><p>Here’s the list:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Higher education will begin pursuing action against organizations offering artificial intelligence to discourage AI usage by students for school work.</strong></p></li></ol><p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in education, higher education institutions may begin pursuing litigation against organizations that offer AI tools or services to students for use in school work. Educational institutions may be concerned about the potential for AI-assisted cheating, as students can use AI tools to complete assignments or exams without fully understanding the material. Institutions may also be worried about the impact AI tools could have on the quality of education, as students may rely too heavily on these tools rather than developing their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, institutions may be concerned about the potential for AI tools to create an unfair advantage for some students, mainly if these tools are only available to students who can afford them.</p><p>To discourage the use of AI in school work, higher education institutions could pursue litigation against organizations that offer these tools, or they could implement policies or guidelines that prohibit the use of AI tools. Institutions could also work with software companies to develop AI tools specifically designed for educational use and less likely to be used for cheating or to undermine the quality of education.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Microsoft will acquire one of the leading product management software platforms to grow its popularity with product teams to cut into Atlassian's market share.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Organizations use product management software to plan, track, and optimize the development of products, and several platforms on the market offer these capabilities. Atlassian is a leading provider of product management software with a range of popular tools, including Jira, Confluence, and Trello. Microsoft is another major product management software market player with its Azure DevOps platform.</p><p>Given the competitive nature of the product management software market, Microsoft may acquire one of the leading platforms to expand its product offerings and increase its market share. Developing a product management software platform would allow Microsoft to offer its customers a more comprehensive suite of tools, making it more attractive to organizations looking for a one-stop solution for their product development needs. Additionally, acquiring a product management software platform could help Microsoft better compete with Atlassian, a significant player in this market. Finally, developing a stronger product management software offering could give Microsoft access to new customers and revenue streams.</p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>A significant security breach will be attributed to a popular consumer mobile app that leverages artificial intelligence and gains attention from US national politics.</strong></p></li></ol><p>As more consumer-facing mobile apps use AI, it is possible that a significant security breach could be attributed to an AI-powered app. This breach could garner considerable attention, mainly if it is widely used and has access to sensitive user data. It is also possible that such a breach could become a topic of national political discussion, mainly if there are concerns about the potential risks of using AI in consumer apps.</p><p>There are a few potential reasons why a security breach involving an AI-powered consumer app could attract political attention. First, the app may have a large user base, which could make the violation more significant. Second, the app may have access to sensitive user data, such as financial or personal information, which could raise concerns about data privacy. Finally, the app may be part of a more significant trend of increasing AI adoption in consumer products. This could lead to broader discussions about AI's potential risks and benefits in this context.</p><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Parental monitoring software will have a meteoric rise in popularity as the need for better monitoring tools grows due to the popularity of apps such as TikTok and Instagram.</strong></p></li></ol><p>With the proliferation of social media and messaging apps, it is increasingly important for parents to monitor their children's online activity to protect them from potential dangers such as cyberbullying, online predators, and inappropriate content. Parental monitoring software, such as Bark.us, helps parents keep track of their children's online activity by providing alerts for potentially concerning behavior or content.</p><p>The popularity of apps such as TikTok and Instagram, particularly popular among younger users, may drive an increased need for parental monitoring tools. These apps have raised concerns about the potential for cyberbullying and the possibility of users being exposed to inappropriate or harmful content. Additionally, the ease with which users can connect with strangers on these platforms may make them more vulnerable to online predators.</p><p>In response to these concerns, parental monitoring software such as Bark.us will likely become more popular as parents look for ways to protect their children online. These tools may be handy for parents who are not as familiar with social media and messaging apps, as they provide an easy way to monitor and manage their children's online activity.</p><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Companies will significantly reduce customer service staffing as case management software will begin depending solely on artificial intelligence to diagnose and solve many customer problems.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Customer service case management software is used by organizations to track and resolve customer inquiries and complaints. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more advanced, customer service case management software will likely rely on AI to help diagnose and solve customer problems.</p><p>There are a few potential reasons why customer service case management software will become more reliant on AI. First, AI can help automate the process of identifying and resolving customer issues, improving efficiency and reducing the workload of customer service representatives. Second, AI can help improve the accuracy of problem diagnosis by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns that may not be obvious to humans. Finally, AI can help provide personalized solutions to customers by analyzing their individual needs and preferences.</p><p>Overall, the increased use of AI in customer service case management software will likely improve the customer experience by providing faster and more accurate resolutions to problems. This, in turn, may lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p><div><hr></div><p>These are five predictions I have for the tech industry in 2023. What are your predictions?
