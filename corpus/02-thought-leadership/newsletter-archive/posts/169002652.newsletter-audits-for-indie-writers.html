<p>Need eyes on your newsletter before you scale or refine your strategy?</p><p>I offer personalized audits focused on onboarding, landing page clarity, and content structure.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Why Me?</h3><p>I’ve been in your shoes. When I started <em><a href="https://www.productparty.us/">Product Party</a></em><a href="https://www.productparty.us/"> </a>in late 2022, I was figuring out how to write consistently, connect with readers, and position my ideas clearly - just like you might be doing now.</p><p>What makes my approach different is that I bring a product and UX lens to everything I read. I’ve spent years helping teams refine their positioning, improve user flows, and make things clearer for the people they serve. I apply that same mindset to newsletters - combining structure, clarity, and reader empathy.</p><p>This isn’t advice from a playbook. It’s hands-on feedback from someone who understands both the writing process and the systems behind it.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What You’ll Get</h3><p>A personalized audit designed to help you grow, engage, and convert through sharper copy and a stronger strategy.
