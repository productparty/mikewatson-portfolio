<p>I’ve been posting lately about the fun technical projects I’ve been diving into, learning new skills, and getting to a place where I can confidently talk shop with engineers (and maybe get fewer side-eyes based on my technical prowess).</p><p>While developing these skills has been a blast, I’ve realized there’s an itch that’s still not getting scratched. So, I started exploring ways to make a different kind of impact.</p><p>After researching my options, I decided to bring my experience and knowledge from the past 10 years back to my roots—management and technology consulting. But with limited time, I’ll focus specifically on pro bono work for nonprofits and (if possible) local startups.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Why get back into consulting?</h3><p>Over the years, I’ve picked up skills I didn’t have when I first started consulting - tools like defining MVPs, measuring impact, and building with user empathy (instead of just following the loudest voice in the room).</p><p>As a product pro, these are second nature now, and I see how they could benefit organizations that need meaningful, high-impact improvements with minimal overhead.</p><p>The ability to prioritize, focus on measurable outcomes, and break down initiatives without unnecessary complexity feels like the right fit for organizations that may not have the bandwidth for large-scale projects. I’m excited to help nonprofits and other organizations create sustainable growth through tech and process.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Product Party is a reader-supported publication.

I’m connecting with nonprofits via Taproot+ and any other sites I can find. </strong><br>I’m going to use platforms like Taproot+ to find organizations needing support for project management and product strategy. </p><p>The verdict is out still but it seems like a great way to connect with nonprofits that need help to take their projects to the next level.</p><p>Do you have any recommendations for connecting with similar organizations?

I’m workshopping concepts to maximize impact with minimized efforts. </strong><br>I’ll be incorporating product-based strategies to reduce the time-to-benefit in these projects. I’m considering a five-step plan that I can share in an elevator pitch to help show how I operate. </p><p>That means focusing on measurable outcomes and even testable solutions where we can so the work is not only impactful but also sustainable.</p><p>The last thing I want to do is persist one of those monolith delivery models that can come with many consulting firms. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3. I’ll be engaging locally in the startup space.</strong><br>Beyond working directly with nonprofits, I’m connecting with my local community to engage with startups that share a vision of giving back. I’m especially interested in early-stage companies that could use strategic guidance or operational insights. </p><p>By attending local events, meetups, and workshops, I hope to foster a network of people committed to building impactful solutions and creating a supportive startup ecosystem.</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:233981}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>While there aren’t any development updates this week, I’ll share progress from my new consulting adventure as I take on new projects. I look forward to seeing where this journey leads and how these projects unfold. </p><p>Have you ever offered independent and/or pro bono consulting? If you're willing to share the wins/fails of these ventures, I would love to hear about them. Just drop me a note, and we can find a way to connect and share our stories. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljameswatson/">Mike</a> @  <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Product Party&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1163348,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/productparty&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66717693-4ad6-43ff-a01e-aeb440a56369_566x566.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;4de3dbdf-9c79-4d66-baa8-03d43be4d606&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> </p><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:1214063,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Mike Watson&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div><p>PS I wanted to give a special shout out to <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kax Uson&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:117457,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9433b855-ba1c-4d92-a591-c9d53016a7cd_675x675.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;e0f9fb95-3370-4072-83be-08950ef6538f&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> for sharing some great insights about her journey.
