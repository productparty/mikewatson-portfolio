At least, not yet.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png" width="466" height="466" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:466,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D8TZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe34cf40f-6df4-4560-a101-693e44e81199_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>This is where AI falls short - there’s an empathy deficit.</strong></h3><p>No matter how well AI can crunch numbers, analyze feedback, or generate user insights, it cannot truly empathize. </p><p>Sure, it can mimic empathetic language or flag common user pain points, but it doesn’t understand the “why” behind those user frustrations. Empathy isn’t just about identifying problems - it’s about understanding the emotional drivers that influence user behavior.</p><p>In my experience, the most meaningful product insights often come from direct, human-to-human interaction. AI might be able to analyze survey responses and flag recurring issues, but it won’t catch the slight pause before a user answers a question or the frustration in their voice when they describe a pain point. </p><p>These subtleties help us, as product people, truly understand the problem.</p><p>Even when AI generates great questions for user interviews, it can’t go off-script. As humans, we can pivot when necessary, ask probing follow-ups, and adapt in real-time based on the emotional cues we pick up. This ability to "read between the lines" is crucial when uncovering deep insights that AI alone might miss.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">To receive new posts and support Product Party, consider becoming a free subscriber.

It helps us zoom out to see the bigger picture and speeds up processes that would take us hours to accomplish manually. But it’s just that - a tool. It can’t replace human intuition, nor should it.</p><p>I’ve worked with AI to analyze user survey data, and it’s been incredibly helpful in categorizing feedback and highlighting recurring themes. Yet, once those insights are surfaced, it’s up to us to dig deeper. The real value comes when we connect the dots and understand the emotions, motivations, and frustrations driving user behavior.</p><p>AI can show us <em>what’s happening</em> - but only humans can uncover <em>why it’s happening</em>.</p><p>This is where time spent directly with users still proves invaluable. No matter how advanced AI becomes, there’s no substitute for hearing directly from users. Getting time in front of them—whether through interviews, observation, or informal chats—is still the best way to uncover deeper insights. </p><p>At a minimum, we should integrate user feedback mechanisms into our processes, allowing us to have honest conversations before deciding which problems to solve. These interactions ground us in reality and help us prioritize based on genuine user needs.</p><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:1214063,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Mike Watson&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><h3><strong>We need to balance AI’s strengths with human capabilities.</strong></h3><p>So, where does that leave us as product professionals? </p><p>The goal isn’t to replace empathy with AI or rely solely on technology for decision-making. Instead, we need to harness AI's strengths to do what it does best - analyze data, provide insights, and save time - while leaning into our human capabilities to build relationships, ask the right questions, and understand users on a deeper level.</p><p>When we combine AI’s analytical power with our ability to empathize and connect with users, we unlock the true potential of product development. AI equips us to be more efficient, but human intuition and empathy transform that efficiency into meaningful impact. </p><p>Without the human element, AI is just a tool; with it, we create products that meet needs and truly resonate. That’s where the magic happens.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Final Thoughts.</strong></h3><p>As it evolves, AI will undoubtedly play an even more significant role in product management. But human empathy remains irreplaceable now and for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Technology will keep evolving, but our ability to connect with users and truly understand their needs will always be the foundation of building great products.</p><p>How are you balancing AI’s strengths with your human capabilities?
