<p>We’ve all been there - trying to figure out the best way to test a new feature idea before pouring time and resources into development. You want to be confident that your hypothesis holds water, but traditional methods often involve guesswork, costly prototypes, or A/B tests that take too long. But what if there was a way to test your ideas before building a single thing? </p><p>That’s where AI-driven simulations come in.</p><p>Picture this: instead of diving headfirst into development, you can now run simulations based on real user data, customer feedback, or even internal business metrics. AI can predict how features will perform so that you can prioritize the ones with the highest likelihood of success. </p><p>Even better? If you’re unsure where to start with a hypothesis, AI can help with that, too, offering ideas for A/B tests or suggesting success criteria.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1733233,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4vnh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe51b6b4f-c8a1-4d6c-9edf-397f5cd5f9b6_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>Inputting Data: Where to Start</strong></h3><p>To leverage AI simulations, start by inputting the right data. Many companies already have valuable datasets at their fingertips, but it's about knowing how to apply them:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Customer Feedback and Survey Data</strong> - Using real feedback from users, AI can simulate how proposed features might address recurring pain points. For example, if users express frustration about onboarding, you can simulate different flows and predict how they’ll affect retention rates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Metrics</strong> - Data such as conversion, churn, and engagement trends are crucial for predicting feature performance. By feeding this data into an AI model, you can estimate how new features will impact KPIs like customer lifetime value or revenue growth.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-Assisted Hypothesis Creation</strong> - If you're struggling to form a clear hypothesis or define success criteria, AI can help. Analyzing your data can suggest A/B testing ideas, relevant metrics to track, and even propose user stories to test. For example, ChatGPT or similar models can generate hypotheses like “Changing the onboarding flow will improve user retention by 10%,” giving you a clear direction for your simulations.</p></li></ol><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Product Party is a reader-supported publication.

If you’re testing a new feature for onboarding, a hypothesis could be: “The new flow will decrease user churn by 15%.” AI models can help refine these hypotheses by suggesting adjustments based on data patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulated A/B Testing</strong> - One of the biggest advantages of AI-driven simulations is the ability to run predictive A/B tests without building the features. Tools like Amazon’s SageMaker and Google Vertex AI allow you to input past data to simulate how different feature variations will perform before you launch them. For example, Amazon’s internal teams have used similar tools to simulate and predict pricing strategy changes ​(<a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/machine-learning-tools-increase-power-of-hypothesis-testing">Amazon Science</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Predicting Behavioral Outcomes</strong> - AI can model how users might interact with new features based on their past behaviors. In one real-world example, machine learning tools increased the statistical power of hypothesis testing by 51%, allowing for more accurate predictions.</p><p><br>This means you can simulate how users will react, adopt, or drop off based on new feature introductions, helping you prioritize the features with the highest chance of success.</p></li></ol><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:1214063,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Mike Watson&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Tools for AI Simulations</strong></h3><p>Here are some tools to help get started with AI simulations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ChatGPT or Similar Language Models</strong> - Feed customer feedback and internal data into ChatGPT to simulate how users might respond to a new feature. These models can generate potential A/B test setups, propose success criteria, and provide insights into likely user behavior based on existing feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google Vertex AI &amp; Amazon SageMaker</strong> - These platforms allow for robust data-driven simulations by inputting your structured data to predict how new features will impact various metrics like conversion rates or retention. Their machine learning models are designed to simulate outcomes and provide actionable insights.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature Modeling Tools</strong> - Platforms like Pendo and Amplitude offer AI-driven modeling that helps product managers simulate feature adoption and predict user engagement, allowing you to test before you build.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Why AI Simulations Lead to Better Features</strong></h3><p>Testing hypotheses through AI simulations isn’t just about cutting costs - it’s about building features that users actually need and will adopt. By running simulations before investing in development, you can refine your ideas and focus on the features most likely to succeed. </p><p>This not only reduces the risk of failed launches but also allows your team to move faster by skipping the guesswork and heading straight to data-backed decisions.</p><p>Additionally, when AI tools help create hypotheses, you get a clearer path forward. They can generate test ideas, suggest relevant success metrics, and even propose feature iterations—all grounded in real data. </p><p>By incorporating AI into your <em>test-and-learn</em> process, you can build smarter, more impactful features that users adopt more quickly.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>AI-driven simulations offer product teams a powerful way to test hypotheses, predict feature performance, and avoid costly development missteps. By feeding customer data, business metrics, and behavioral insights into these models, you can prioritize the right features and minimize risks. And if you’re unsure where to start, AI can even help you craft hypotheses, set up A/B tests, and define success criteria.</p><p>Have you started experimenting with AI simulations yet?
