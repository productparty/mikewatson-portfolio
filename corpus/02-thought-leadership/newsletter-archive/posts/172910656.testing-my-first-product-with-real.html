<p>I've been thinking about this moment for months - the shift from "I should build something" to actually putting it out there and seeing if anyone cares. You know that feeling when you've been tinkering with an idea in your head, refining it through conversations and late-night notes, and suddenly you realize the only way forward is to test it with real people?</p><p>That's exactly where I am with a new offering - <a href="https://www.notion.so/marketplace/templates/product-party-the-founder-starter-pack">Product Party - The Founder Startup

decision-making chaos, I've created what I believe is a practical system for turning assumptions into evidence quickly. Not in months - in weeks.</p><p>It's a collection of templates, scripts, and frameworks designed around one core insight: most founders don't fail because they lack good ideas. </p><p>They fail because they can't distinguish between good ideas and ideas that solve real problems for people who'll actually pay for solutions.</p><p>The pack includes everything from feature scoring systems to proven conversation scripts to weekly review templates. Think of it as the decision-making infrastructure I wish I'd had during my first startup.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Product Party!

I've seen too many products that solve theoretical problems while missing the real friction points entirely.</p><p>So I'm taking a different approach.</p><p></p><h4>I'm looking for five founders to collaborate with me on this project.</h4><p>Specifically, founders who are:</p><ul><li><p>Currently building something (not just thinking about it)</p></li><li><p>Wrestling with feature prioritization or user validation decisions</p></li><li><p>Willing to use these templates for 2-3 weeks and give me honest feedback</p></li><li><p>Open to a couple of brief conversations about what's working and what isn't</p></li></ul><p>In exchange, you'll get the entire pack for free, plus direct access to me to iterate on it based on your actual experience. </p><p>Think of it as early access to something we'll refine together.</p><div><hr></div><h2>What I'm hoping to learn.</h2><p>I want to understand which parts immediately click and which parts feel like unnecessary overhead. </p><p>Are the conversation scripts actually helpful, or do they feel scripted? </p><p>Does the feature scoring system clarify decisions, or does it add complexity? </p><p>Which templates do you find yourself using repeatedly, and which ones gather digital dust?</p><p></p><p>Most importantly: does this actually help you move faster from uncertainty to evidence-based decisions?</p><div><hr></div><h2>The ask.</h2><p>If this resonates with where you are right now as a founder, I'd love to hear from you. </p><p>Send me a message - tell me a bit about what you're building and what decision-making challenges you're facing. I'll share the pack with the first five founders whose situations align well with what I'm trying to solve.</p><div class="directMessage button" data-attrs="{&quot;userId&quot;:1214063,&quot;userName&quot;:&quot;Mike Watson&quot;,&quot;canDm&quot;:null,&quot;dmUpgradeOptions&quot;:null,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}" data-component-name="DirectMessageToDOM"></div><p>This isn't about finding people to validate what I've already built. It's about finding the right founders to help me build something genuinely useful.</p><p>Because the difference between a product that works and one that actually helps often comes down to those crucial early conversations with people who have the problem you think you're solving.</p><div><hr></div><h2>A small confession.</h2><p>I'm nervous about this. There's something vulnerable about putting your first real product out there, even in test form. But I've learned that the best products come from founders who are willing to be wrong about their initial assumptions and iterate based on real feedback.</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>I appreciate you all and look forward to helping out some awesome new companies!</p><p></p><p>Until next week,</p><p>Mike @ <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/productparty">Product Party</a></p><p>Want to connect?
