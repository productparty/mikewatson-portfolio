<p>Transcript:</p><p>Today, we're going to talk about how product managers can begin using product discovery in an organization that has never had product managers before. But before we dive into that, let's first define what we mean by "product discovery."</p><p>Product discovery is the process of finding out what products or features to build next, and determining how to build them in a way that meets the needs of customers and delivers value to the business. It's a critical part of the product development process, and it's the responsibility of product managers to lead this process.</p><p>So, if you're a product manager who is new to your organization, and your organization has never had product managers before, how do you go about implementing product discovery?</p><p>First and foremost, it's important to understand the goals and objectives of the organization. What are the company's overall business goals, and how can product development help achieve them? It's also important to understand the target market and customers, as well as the competitive landscape. This information will help guide the product discovery process and ensure that any products or features being developed align with the overall strategy of the organization.</p><p>Next, it's time to gather insights and ideas for potential products or features. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as conducting customer research and interviews, analyzing user data and feedback, and even brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams. The goal here is to identify problems or opportunities that the organization can solve or address through product development.</p><p>Once you have a list of potential product or feature ideas, it's time to prioritize them. This is where the trade-off between customer needs, business value, and technical feasibility comes into play. You'll need to evaluate each idea based on these factors and determine which ones are the most viable and align with the organization's goals. This can be done through techniques such as value proposition mapping, which helps to visualize the potential value and impact of each idea.</p><p>Once you have a prioritized list of ideas, it's time to start experimenting and validating them. This is where the concept of "minimum viable product," or MVP, comes into play. An MVP is a stripped-down version of a product or feature that allows you to test and validate the core value proposition with minimal effort and resources. By building and testing MVPs, you can quickly gather feedback and data to inform the next steps in the product development process.</p><p>It's important to note that product discovery is an ongoing process, and it's not always a linear one. There will be times when you need to pivot or iterate based on new insights or changing market conditions. The key is to remain agile and flexible, and to continuously gather and analyze data to inform your decisions.</p><p>In conclusion, implementing product discovery in an organization that has never had product managers before can be a challenging but rewarding process. By understanding the organization's goals and target market, gathering and prioritizing ideas, and experimenting and validating them through MVPs, you can help drive the product development process and deliver value to both customers and the business.</p><p>Thanks for watching!</p>
