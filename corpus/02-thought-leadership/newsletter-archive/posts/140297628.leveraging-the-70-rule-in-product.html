While we don’t all aspire to be a billionaire like him (although…a few extra $ wouldn’t hurt), some interesting ways of working have come out over time that I find interesting. The biggest one I’ve learned about recently is the 70% rule.</p><p>Incorporating Bezos' 70% Rule is particularly relevant in product management, where waiting for complete information can lead to missed opportunities and delays in product development and iteration. </p><p>Here's how you can apply this rule effectively.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What is the 70% Rule?</h3><p>The 70% rule, often associated with Jeff Bezos, suggests that decisions in business and management should be made with about 70% of the information you ideally want. </p><p>This approach encourages prompt decision-making and agility, recognizing that waiting for complete information can lead to delays and missed opportunities.</p><p>The principle emphasizes the importance of being decisive with substantial, albeit not complete, data and maintaining flexibility to adapt or correct decisions as more information becomes available or circumstances change. </p><p>This rule is particularly effective in dynamic environments like product management, where rapid iteration and responsiveness are key to success.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Early and Iterative Decision-Making</h3><p>In product management, it's crucial to make decisions early and iteratively. </p><p>By applying the 70% rule, you can start with a substantial but incomplete information set. </p><p>This approach allows for faster decision-making and product iterations or feature launches. </p><p>It aligns with agile methodologies, where iterative development is emphasized, and products continuously improve based on feedback and new insights.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Product Party is a reader-supported publication.
