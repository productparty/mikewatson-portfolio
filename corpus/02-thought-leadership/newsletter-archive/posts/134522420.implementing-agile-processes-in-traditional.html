The unfamiliar rhythm, terminology, and all of those sometimes redundant meetings can initially be overwhelming. However, the promised benefits of enhanced collaboration, increased productivity, and quicker product delivery make this shift enticing. </p><p>I’d like to share an example of our journey into the Agile world at NewRez, a mortgage fintech company I worked at a couple of years back, which was all waterfall all the time up until I joined. I will cover adopting Agile and effective change management, adjusting stakeholder expectations, and empowering our development team.</p><p>Let’s dig in.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Encouraging the Development Team to Embrace Agile</strong></h3><p>The first step in our Agile journey at NewRez was establishing buy-in from our development team. Given the significant shift from their familiar workflows, we approached this with a clear change management strategy. We adopted the WIFM or "what's in it for me" approach, highlighting Agile's benefits to their daily tasks and the flexibility it would provide. They squawked a bit when we asked them for things like sizing work, but things started to change when we established the why and highlighted when we were using them. </p><p>Initially, the team perceived Agile's frequent meetings as disruptive, reducing their focus time. But we really gained their buy-in by continuously emphasizing the value of these collaborative practices and showcasing their potential to reduce miscommunication. Over time, the team began to appreciate our new Agile-ish rhythm, noticing the advantages of ongoing communication and immediate problem-solving.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.productparty.us/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Product Party is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free subscriber.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email…" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Educating Stakeholders and Managing Expectations</strong></h3><p>While securing buy-in from the development team was crucial, educating our stakeholders about the changes was equally important. Stakeholders were used to dictating all process aspects, including UI/UX design, even without specific expertise in these areas.</p><p>We held dedicated training sessions to explain the Agile philosophy and benefits, emphasizing that it's a team effort involving various experts. We clarified that they wouldn't lose their influence; their input would become part of a more dynamic conversation. Managing their expectations was key to maintaining a healthy, productive relationship between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><p>Just to be clear to all of you product folks who might fall into this at times: Roadmaps are cool and all, but I would highly recommend NEVER committing to an ETA unless you’re in lock step with your dev team - have sizing, have a plan, etc. Be sure to bake in change management time as well. Not hitting deadlines DESTROYS your credibility regardless if it’s your fault or it’s on the dev team. Also - don’t differentiate when you do need to talk about deadlines and potential sliding. You’re all one team and moving away from this vibe can be a trust killer with your team. </p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Leveraging User Stories and Streamlining Product Delivery</strong></h3><p>Another significant shift was transitioning from long, exhaustive write-ups to user stories with acceptance criteria. While initially met with skepticism, we highlighted that this approach allows for greater flexibility and encourages innovative problem-solving. These clear acceptance criteria sparked a new creative momentum in the team.</p><p>Ultimately, Agile's nature of breaking down large projects into smaller tasks can lead to quicker, more frequent product updates and shorter lead times to market/going live. By incorporating metrics tracking and analyzing customer sessions, we were able to continually refine our processes, making our product more responsive and user-centered.</p><p>Need some data to share with your friends to move them out of the old school?
