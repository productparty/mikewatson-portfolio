efficiency and productivity. </p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/authorjmac/?hl=en">Joanna Maciejewska </a>highlights the importance of directing AI towards freeing up time for creative pursuits rather than increasing work demands.</p><p>Should AI help us focus on more meaningful activities by taking over mundane tasks, or will we work more efficiently without reducing our hours? </p><p>This week, we explore how AI could help reshape our work-life balance and whether we should shift towards outcome-based expectations.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Current Landscape</h3><p>Despite all the innovation focused on productivity in the last 10+ years, many people still work well over 40-hour weeks.</p><p>As we all know, AI can automate routine tasks like scheduling and data management. </p><p>Depending on what you do for your day-to-day job, the benefits could help free up time for more strategic and creative work. </p><p>However, as more and more companies implement tools that tap into “AI,” these gains in efficiency are also leading to increased expectations instead of lighter workloads.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Outcome-Based Expectations</h3><p>Maciejewska's quote encourages us to rethink AI's role. </p><p>For many of us - and if you’re not there yet, you will someday - the realization of how important prioritizing our time effectively is. </p><p>With AI handling continuing to handle more mundane tasks, we can have an opportunity to shift from time-based work to <a href="https://www.rullion.co.uk/employers/knowledge-hub/blog/change-dlivery/outcome-based-working-all-you-need-to-know/">outcome-based work.</a> </p><p></p><p>If you’re interested in learning about outcome-based work, check out this video:</p><div id="youtube2-T478ezZqLKA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;T478ezZqLKA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe

allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><p>Making a change, such as moving to outcome-based work, means focusing on the quality and impact of our work rather than the hours spent on it. </p><p>This shift can promote a healthier work-life balance, where success is measured by results rather than time.</p><p></p><p>Consider a marketing team using AI tools to automate data analysis and campaign scheduling. </p><p>Instead of measuring success by the hours spent on these tasks, the team focuses on achieving specific goals, such as increasing website traffic by 20% or boosting engagement on social media. </p><p>This shift allows team members to invest more time in creative strategy and content creation, ultimately leading to more innovative and effective marketing campaigns.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Cultural and Organizational Change</h3><p>So why should companies change the landscape and way of working? </p><p>We know this type of change would be incredibly disruptive for most.</p><p>However, as company leaders become more knowledgeable about these ways of working, perhaps making the case for change will become easier. </p><p class="button-wrapper"

cultural shift toward prioritizing well-being, which leads to a more engaged and productive workforce. </p><p>Happier employees tend to be more creative, resilient, and loyal, which improves retention and reduces turnover costs. </p><p>Focusing on outcomes rather than hours worked fosters innovation and better performance, benefiting the company's bottom line. </p><p>This approach creates a positive work environment, aligning employee satisfaction with business success, making it a win-win for the organization and its employees.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>AI offers a transformative opportunity to rethink how we approach work. </p><p>By automating mundane tasks, we can reclaim time for creative and meaningful activities. </p><p>Embracing outcome-based work allows for a healthier balance, aligning employee satisfaction with business success.</p><p></p><p>How do you envision AI shaping your work-life balance?
