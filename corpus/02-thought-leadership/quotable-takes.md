# Quotable Takes

Short, punchy opinions that capture Mike's perspective.

## On AI in Product
- "Adopt AI for efficiency, not for thinking"
- "Our job isn't just to ship features; it's to solve human problems in human ways"
- "AI can't decide what to build, when to cut, when to iterate, or when to ship. That's still human work."
- "Tools like Cursor and Perplexity make building accessible, but they don't replace developers. They close the gap enough that product people can experience the process viscerally."

## On Product Management Reality
- "If you consistently produce products that leave your users unsatisfied because you didn't understand their needs, will you still feel good about your work as a product person?"
- "People problems are harder than code problems."
- "The technical barrier to building an app is lower than ever. But the process barrier? That's where you prove you're serious about shipping quality software."

## On Career Development
- "Your career progression isn't about climbing a ladder anymore. It's about building a web."
- "Strong employees should think about becoming default essential. Not only will this make your job safer, but it will also demonstrate that you are a committed leader."
- "The market for experience exists. It's just not where we thought it was."

## On Prioritization
- "Feature diet > feature factory"
- "Knowing what NOT to ship is the real skill."
- "Differentiation without parity is just being different, not better."
- "That's not failure. That's product judgment. The feature flag system let me build ambitious and cut intelligently."

## On Stakeholder Management
- "The moment we started setting clearer boundaries around new requests, everything changed. The work hadn't changed. Our boundaries had."
- "When you ask them to articulate why this matters more than planned work, half the time they realize it's not as urgent as they thought."

## On Building Products
- "You don't need to be a software engineer to build and ship real products anymore"
- "Coding wasn't the hard part. Building ambitious features wasn't hard either. The surprisingly hard part? Knowing which features NOT to ship."
- "Your time has value. Your momentum has value. Sometimes paying a small amount to solve a blocker is the smartest decision you can make."

## On Technical Skills
- "Unless your engineering team needs it, constantly being technical runs the risk of curbing their creativity and desire to work with you."
- "Most software engineers chose their career path because they love solving problems. They're uniquely equipped to solve these problems."
- "When developers push back on timelines or talk about technical debt, I get it now—because I've made those same tradeoff decisions."
